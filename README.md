# Exercises from Udemy's C# Course

This repository contains a collection of exercises developed while studying **C# and Object-Oriented Programming** through a Udemy course. The goal of this project is to consolidate fundamental and intermediate C# concepts by implementing small, focused console applications and examples.

All exercises are organized by topic, following the progression of the course, and are written entirely in **C#**.
