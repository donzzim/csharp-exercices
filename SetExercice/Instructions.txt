In an online course portal, each user has a unique code, represented by an integer number.

Each instructor on the portal can have several courses, and a student can enroll in as many courses as they want. Therefore, the total number of students of an instructor is not simply the sum of the students from all their courses, since the same student may be enrolled in more than one course.

Instructor Alex has three courses, A, B, and C, and wants to know the total number of students.

Your program must read the students from courses A, B, and C of instructor Alex, and then display his total number of students, according to the example.
